# Banana-Republic-Round-2

## Getting started 

```
npm init
npm install --save
```

```
npm install --save serve
// add start script to package json: "start": "serve"
```

```
npm start
// in console
```

```
The form 
// The form buttons 'Save' and 'Cancel' I have left on "clear" as per requirements
```

```
js
// I have not added js in this program, it is small and I was trying to keep it uniform however as mentioned in the comments, for the form, I think it would've been another option to toggle the selected fields with an onClick event listener. I went back and forth a bit with best practice as I felt the code was getting a bit clompy without js, however, stuck to my guns as it is small and css is fun... 
```


```
Here are the requirements given
Requirements:
// Follow best practices.
The client only requires us to build the specified page.
On clicking the right arrow at the bottom of the left panel, the content panel (orange) slides open over the form.
On clicking the left arrow at the bottom of the left panel, the content panel closes.
The panel must expand with an animation from left to right.
On mobile, the panel expands to the bottom.
On mobile, once expanded: scroll to show the expanded panel in view. (Top of the screen).
Submit button: the form does not have to submit.
Cancel button: needs to clear all fields.
Ignore the input validation requirements that are implied by the designs.
